# Learning-Programing-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-using-Python

This repository documents my personal learning journey through **algorithmic problem-solving in Python**, focusing on **Backtracking** and **Dynamic Programming**.  
Each notebook is a reflection of exploration, reasoning, and progressive learning of core algorithmic thinking.

---

## 🧭 Motivation
As a faculty member transitioning from Mechanical Engineering to AI & Data Science, I began this journey to strengthen my problem-solving mindset and teaching foundation.  
These notebooks are both a record of my own learning and open resources for students and educators exploring Python algorithms.

## 📘 Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Backtracking/` | Recursive and decision-tree-based problems (N-Queens, Rat in Maze, Word Search). |
| `DynamicProgramming/` | Problems solved using optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems (Jump Game II, Climbing Stairs, etc.). |

---

## 🧩 Learning Highlights

- **Backtracking**  
  - Recursive exploration and state cleanup  
  - Pruning decisions to avoid redundant paths  
  - Applications: Maze solving, N-Queens, Word Search  

- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**  
  - Transition from recursion to memoization to tabulation  
  - Identifying optimal substructure  
  - Greedy vs DP intuition building  

---

## 🧠 Reflections
> “Understanding *why* a state transition works is more important than *writing* the transition.”

This repository represents a gradual shift from **trial and error** to **structured thinking** — mirroring how I guide students to build algorithmic intuition rather than memorizing patterns.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Extend this series to **Greedy Algorithms**  
- Build a **visual guide** for each DP pattern  
- Connect algorithmic concepts to **Machine Learning optimization** (Phase 2)

## 🌐 Run Notebooks Online
You can open any notebook directly in **Google Colab** by clicking:  
`Open in Colab → File → Save a copy in Drive`  
*(Add Colab badges later if you want, I can show you how)*
